# wunder-task
iOS task by Wunder

As part of test assignment we would like to ask you to build an app which tackles the
problems we face in Wunder everyday. The app should access a JSON feed of cars:
"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wunderbucket/locations.json", persist
them and display the information in two different sections.

Section 1:
Display all the cars information in a list.

Section 2:
Display all the cars in the map (plus the user updated location).

After tapping a car on the map, the others should disappear and the car name
should be displayed on top of the map pin, tapping again on the car will hide the
car name and show again the other cars' pins.
Feel free to design UI as you find it best, we do not have any restrictions here! You are
welcome to add more features to our small app, if you see a need. You can
use third party libraries as much as you want.
